AP CS Final Project - Fall
==============
ModelSim is a simple housing price predictor using logistic regression on historical data with a Graphical User Interface.

Note: OpenJDK has failed to consistently set the insets (border size of window) and causes an unusual shift in the graph. This problem is not apparent with Oracle's HotSpot JVM (tested on OS X, Windows 7, and Linux).
